We provid 2 datasets for vibration control of the ZV input shaper. Each dataset includes 500 sampling points, collected from a vertical flexiblebeam with single axis motion. In these datasets, "freq" and "zeta" are system parameters representing undamped natural frequency and damping ratio, respectively, and "Y-acceleration" is the absolute value of the maximum acceleration on the Y axis at the end of the flexible beam.
